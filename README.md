The **CIFAR-10** (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision and deep learning. It consists of **60,000 color images** categorized into **10 classes**, with **6,000 images per class**. The dataset is divided into:
- **50,000 training images**
- **10,000 test images**

Each image is **32Ã—32** pixels with **3 color channels (RGB)**. The dataset is often used for training and evaluating image classification models.
