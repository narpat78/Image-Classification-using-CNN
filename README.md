## **CIFAR-10 Dataset**

The **CIFAR-10** (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision and deep learning. It consists of **60,000 color images** categorized into **10 classes**, with **6,000 images per class**. The dataset is divided into:
- **45,000 training images**
- **5,000 validation images**
- **10,000 test images**

Each image is **32Ã—32** pixels with **3 color channels (RGB)**. The dataset is often used for training and evaluating image classification models.

**Classes in CIFAR-10**

The dataset includes the following 10 object categories:

## **Model Performance & Generalization**

- With a **test accuracy** of **88.49%**, our model demonstrates strong generalization to unseen data. This balance between accuracy and efficiency highlights its ability to learn meaningful patterns rather than just memorizing the training data.
- The model's effectiveness was further validated by testing on **5 unseen images** sourced from Google. Impressively, it correctly classified **all 5 images**, demonstrating its strong generalization beyond the training dataset.
